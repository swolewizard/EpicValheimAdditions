**ALL EVA MISTLANDS CONTENT IS DISABLED BY DEFAULT**

The EVA Mistlands content has been seamlessly integrated into vanilla Mistlands, enhancing the existing experience. If you choose to re-enable Mistlands in the configuration, it will only further enrich the depth of the vanilla gameplay.

## New Content and Features

### New Mobs:
- Ashlands: We've introduced two formidable creatures, the "Magma Skarab" and the "Infernal Minotaur."
- Deep North: Inhabitants of the Deep North now include the elusive "Crystalhide Ursar" and the ethereal "Frostwing Fae."
- Ocean: Witness the arrival of the menacing "Draugr Mariner."

### New Weapons:
- We've expanded the weapon arsenal with the addition of 13 Weapons for each tier (Mistlands/Heavymetal, Deep North/Frometal, and Ashlands/Flametal), including Bows, Atgeirs, Warhammers, Battleaxes, Spears, Knives, Spiked Maces, Greatswords, Swords, Shields, Tower Shields, Axes, and Pickaxes.
- In the depths of the Ocean (Deep Abyss), discover three new Weapons – Bows, Tridents, and Greatswords.

### Environment Enhancements:
- Immerse yourself in enhanced environments as we've enriched the Ash Lands and Deep North with a variety of new vegetation, including bushes, trees, rocks, and pickable vegetation.
- In the Ashlands, you'll find Burning Trees with three distinct variations. Beware, as these trees have a dangerous burning radius, adding urgency to fell them swiftly.
- Both the Ashlands and Deep North now feature pickable vegetation, opening up new possibilities for crafting delectable recipes.
- Vegetation in the Ashlands can now drop seeds, enabling cultivation within this unique biome.

### Vegvisirs and Altars:
- Navigate the challenging terrains of Mistlands, Deepnorth, and Ashlands with the help of custom Vegvisirs, which guide you to the nearest corresponding boss altar.
- Discover mysterious custom boss altars scattered throughout the Mistlands, Deepnorth, and Ashlands.

### Golden Mini-bosses:
- Seek out golden mini-boss altars across the Meadows, Black Forest, and Swamp biomes. By offering the corresponding trophy, you can summon powerful golden mini-boss versions of these creatures.

### Food and Recipes:
- New mobs & vegetation drop essential ingredients for crafting exciting food recipes.
- In the Ashlands, savor the introduction of three new food items – Health, Stamina, and Eitr-infused delicacies.
- The Deep North offers its own trio of new food items, providing boosts to Health, Stamina, and Eitr levels.

### Creature Interaction:
- Forge a unique bond with the "Crystalhide Ursar" mob in the Deep North as you tame, command, and raise its cubs.

### Resource Gathering:
- Explore the Mistlands to harvest precious Heavymetal veins for ingots.
- In the Deep North, gather resources from trees, icebergs, Frometal veins, and mushrooms.
- The Ashlands hold treasures in the form of trees, flowers, and meteorites for resource harvesting.

### Crafting Changes:
- EVA Bosses now yield "Pickaxe Heads" and "Axe Heads" (per player), essential components for crafting tools to advance to the next tier.
- Introducing the "Thors Forge," a new crafting table for crafting Flametal, Frometal, and Heavymetal items.

### World Upgrades:
- Enhance your world with ease using the custom "Upgrade world" console commands: "EVA_upgrade_mistlands," "EVA_upgrade_deepnorth," "EVA_upgrade_ashlands," and "EVA_upgrade." These commands generate locations and vegetation in your world when the "Upgrade world" mod is installed.
